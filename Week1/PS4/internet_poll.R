# What proportion of interviewees who answered the Worry.About.Info question worry about how much information
# is available about them on the Internet?
sum(limited$Worry.About.Info==1, na.rm=T)/nrow(limited -2) # 2 is the number of NA in this column
# What proportion of interviewees who answered the Anonymity.Possible question think it is possible to be completely anonymous on the Internet?
